      <p>I'm a paragraph about accordions inside of an accordion:</p>
      <p>Accordions (from 19th-century German Akkordeon, from Akkord—"musical chord, concord of sounds"[1]) are a family of box-shaped musical instruments of the bellows-driven free-reed aerophone type, colloquially referred to as a squeezebox. A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist. The concertina and bandoneón are related; the harmonium and American reed organ are in the same family.</p>
